			Gruvbox 8 colorscheme			*gruvbox8*

Gruvbox 8 is a popular colorscheme originally designed by morhetz. The Vim
version comes in three variants:

- gruvbox8: "medium" contrast;
- gruvbox8_hard: "hard" contrast;
- gruvbox8_soft: "soft" contrast.

Each variant supports dark and light backgrounds, so you must set 'background'
before loading the colorscheme. For example:
>
	set background=dark
	colorscheme gruvbox8
<
Gruvbox 8 requires at least 256 colors and supports "true color" terminals.
